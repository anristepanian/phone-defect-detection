# Phone Defect Detection Model / Project

An online shopping platform for sustainable products is growing rapidly. Despite the desirable development of the company, this also comes with new challenges. As one example, as more and more products are ordered via the platform, the number of items sent back for refund also increases. The workforce that is necessary to categorize the re-shipped products has increased in the last month beyond a viable amount. As the newly employed data scientist of the company, you are assigned the task of developing a machine learning model that automatically classifies the refund items into categories based on pictures of the items. Your model should run as a service that can be triggered in batches overnight. This project hopes to reduce the workforce and costs for manually sorting items. Instead, incoming goods will automatically be categorized daily.
